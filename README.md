# Secure Blocks for Gutenberg

Secure your content in the editor by user role with Secure Blocks for Gutenberg.

Using Secure Blocks you can add any Gutenberg block inside a secure block, have it render only to logged in users, or lock it down to a user role of your choosing.

Secure Blocks also provides an additional area that can display blocks to users that do not have permission to view the content.

The plugin provides the following functionality:

- Display content only to logged-users
- Display alternative content to logged-out users
- Display content to users within certain user roles
- Display alternative content to users not in those user roles
