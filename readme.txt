Secure your content in the editor by user role with Secure Blocks for Gutenberg

== Description ==

Secure your content in the editor by user role with Secure Blocks for Gutenberg.

Using Secure Blocks you can add any Gutenberg block inside a secure block, have it render only to logged in users, or lock it down to a user role of your choosing.

Secure Blocks also provides an additional area that can display blocks to users that do not have permission to view the content.
